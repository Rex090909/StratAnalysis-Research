In particular, the demand for ready-to-use and premium-quality sauces is expected to drive this growth. North America will continue to dominate the market, but emerging markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin America are anticipated to experience significant growth due to changing eating habits and increased fast food consumption.</p><p>To summarize, the cheese sauce market has evolved from 2018 to 2022, driven by consumer preference for convenience, flavor innovation, and healthier options.
